>Think of a problem that's interesting for you and find a dataset for that
>Describe this problem and explain how a model could be used
>Prepare the data and doing EDA, analyze important features
>Train multiple models, tune their performance and select the best model
>Export the notebook into a script
>Put your model into a web service and deploy it locally with Docker
>Bonus points for deploying the service to the cloud

--- Repository should contain:
README.md with
    Description of the problem
    Instructions on how to run the project
Data
    You should either commit the dataset you used or have clear instructions how to download the dataset
Notebook (suggested name - notebook.ipynb) with
    Data preparation and data clearning
    EDA, feature importance analysis
    Model selection process and parameter tuning
Script train.py (suggested name)
    Training the final model
    Saving it to a file (e.g. pickle) or saving it with specialized software (BentoML)
Script predict.py (suggested name)
    Loading the model
    Serving it via a web serice (with Flask or specialized sofware - BentoML, KServe, etc)
Files with dependencies
    Pipenv and Pipenv.lock if you use Pipenv
    or equivalents: conda environment file, requirements.txt or pyproject.toml
Dockerfile for running the service
Deployment
    URL to the service you deployed or
    Video or image of how you interact with the deployed service
